# Self-projects
# Animal classification project(deep learning) - Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras CNN to classify animal images into multiple species (e.g., Panda, Dog, Kangaroo, etc.).Preprocessed dataset with image augmentation and normalization for better generalization.Achieved >90% accuracy on validation data. Implemented a prediction pipeline to classify new unseen images with confidence scores.
# Lung cancer project(Machine learning) - Developed a predictive system to estimate patient survival using clinical and lifestyle features (age, stage, smoking status, comorbidities, treatment, etc.). Conducted EDA & feature engineering (date parsing, treatment duration, categorical encoding). Handled class imbalance (~78% vs 22%) with class_weight and scale_pos_weight.Compared models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and selected the best by ROC-AUC. Produced a saved model (lung_survival_model.joblib) for deployment and demonstrated predictions on new patient data.
