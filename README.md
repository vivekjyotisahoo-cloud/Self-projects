# Self-projects
# Animal classification project(deep learning) - Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras CNN to classify animal images into multiple species (e.g., Panda, Dog, Kangaroo, etc.).Preprocessed dataset with image augmentation and normalization for better generalization.Achieved >90% accuracy on validation data. Implemented a prediction pipeline to classify new unseen images with confidence scores.
# Lung cancer project(Machine learning) - Developed a predictive system to estimate patient survival using clinical and lifestyle features (age, stage, smoking status, comorbidities, treatment, etc.). Conducted EDA & feature engineering (date parsing, treatment duration, categorical encoding). Handled class imbalance (~78% vs 22%) with class_weight and scale_pos_weight.Compared models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and selected the best by ROC-AUC. Produced a saved model (lung_survival_model.joblib) for deployment and demonstrated predictions on new patient data.
# SQL project based on olympic games- This project focuses on building an SQL-based data analysis pipeline using Olympics datasets (1994–2024). The raw data was cleaned and structured into an SQLite database, enabling efficient querying of medal records, country-wise trends, and India’s performance. Complex SQL queries were written to extract insights such as total medals, medal distribution by country, and historical trends. The results were further integrated with Python (Pandas & Matplotlib) to generate visualizations, making the analysis both comprehensive and interactive.
